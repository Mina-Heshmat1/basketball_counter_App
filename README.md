## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, you'll need to know the basics of Flutter! Aside from that, you'll need a local computer where you can install Dart, and edit some files. We'll walk you through that part, so if you haven't used Dart before -- don't worry. We recommend that you should have already completed Chat Gpt Front-End Foundations course, or have basic familiarity with Dart lunguega. When we say basic familiarity here's what we mean:

If you know these, you should be all set to jump in and give this project a shot!
